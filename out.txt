Life is painful
 
 And discover the lessons
 
 The lessons are always about you
 
 Which mistakes did you make and which changes do you need to make? The pain will help you remember the lessons well
 
 Every lesson is for today and tomorrow only
 
 So that every painful event holds a lesson which leads towards better choices today and tomorrow
 
 So, with one small step at a time, the lessons you teach yourself lead to better choices and a better life
 
 AND the only way to a better life is by making these improvements to yourself
 
 Your heart, mind, and spirit are the only things you will have all the days of your life
 
 So you must apply all lessons within
 
 If no changes are made within (to your THOUGHTS, ACTIONS, AND CHOICES) then no lesson has been learned even when you remember it well
 
 Internal changes are the foundation and root of all improvements to your life
 
 Remember that this is a long term approach to life and it moves in harmony with the fact that life is a journey of decades
 
 Every decade has many lessons to teach
 
 Think of your life as a long and winding river
